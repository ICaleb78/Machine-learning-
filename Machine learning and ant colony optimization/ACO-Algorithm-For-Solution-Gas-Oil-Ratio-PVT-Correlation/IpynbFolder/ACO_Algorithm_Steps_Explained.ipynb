    "### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Ant Colony Optimization:** Implements ACO to optimize parameters for the GOR prediction model, providing a novel approach to solving this complex problem.\n",
    "- **Statistical Analysis:** Includes detailed statistical analysis comparing the new model's performance with established correlations like Standing’s, Glaso’s, and Petrosky’s.\n",
    "- **Streamlit Deployment:** Deploys the prediction model as an interactive web application using Streamlit, enabling users to input PVT data and receive GOR predictions ins### Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "The Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm inspired our approach to optimizing the gas-oil ratio (GOR) prediction model. Here's how the principles of ant colony behavior relate to our problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decentralized Intelligence:** Like ants use decentralized intelligence to find food, our algorithm uses multiple agents (ants) to explore the solution space for the best-fit parameters.\n",
    "- **Pheromone Trails:** Ants communicate via pheromones, leaving trails that signal the path to food. Similarly, our algorithm leaves \"pheromone\" signals on promising paths (parameter combinations) that lead to accurate GOR predictions.\n",
    "- **Exploration and Exploitation:** Ants balance following existing pheromone trails and exploring new paths. Our algorithm also balances between exploiting known good parameters and exploring new combinations to avoid local minima.\n",
    "- **Convergence:** Over time, ants converge on the shortest path to food. Our algorithm defines the best parameter combinations as the \"shortest path\" to accurate GOR predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "- **Superior Accuracy:** The developed correlation outperforms traditional methods, showing lower average relative error and higher correlation coefficients.\n",
    "- **Enhanced Reliability:** Engineers can rely on this newly developed correlation after validation with field data, ensuring better accuracy in the region where the correlation was developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The project demonstrates the potential of ACO in optimizing GOR predictions and highlights the benefits of the developed correlation over traditional methods. Future work includes further refinement of the ACO algorithm for faster convergence and broader applicability.\n",
