    "## Project Objectives\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to use the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** algorithm to improve the estimation of **Solution Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR)** by identifying correlations with **Pressure-Volume-Temperature (PVT)** conditions. This approach will enable the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Optimize GOR Estimation**: Enhance the accuracy of GOR predictions based on PVT correlations.\n",
    "2. **Identify Optimal PVT Conditions**: Discover the conditions that maximize or minimize GOR values.\n",
    "3. **Uncover Correlation Patterns**: Reveal the relationships between GOR and various PVT parameters (e.g., downhole pressure, temperature) to inform better reservoir management.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Columns for ACO Analysis\n",
    "The ACO algorithm will focus on the following columns to determine optimal conditions for GOR:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculated_GOR**: The target variable representing the solution gas-oil ratio.\n",
    "- **AVG_DOWNHOLE_PRESSURE**: Downhole pressure, a critical factor affecting GOR.\n",
    "- **AVG_DOWNHOLE_TEMPERATURE**: Downhole temperature, which influences the solution gas-oil ratio.\n",
    "- **BORE_OIL_VOL** and **BORE_GAS_VOL**: Volumes of produced oil and gas, which can help establish relationships with GOR.\n",
    "- **Wellbore Name** *(optional)*: To distinguish between different wells if unique PVT correlations are applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "1. **ACO Algorithm Setup**: Configure the ACO algorithm to explore different combinations of downhole pressure, temperature, and other parameters to optimize the calculated GOR.\n",
    "2. **Objective Function**: Define an objective function for ACO to minimize errors between predicted and actual GOR values.\n",
    "3. **Analysis of Results**: Examine the output to identify PVT conditions that consistently yield optimal GOR values, aiding in well performance optimization.\n"

    "### Ant Colony Optimization Class Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the code defines the initialization function for the `AntColonyOptimization` class, setting up key parameters and structures necessary for the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Library Import**:  \n",
    "   The `numpy` library is imported to provide tools for matrix operations and efficient numerical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Definition**:  \n",
    "   The `AntColonyOptimization` class is created to structure the algorithm in a single, organized class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization Method (`__init__`)**:  \n",
    "   The `__init__` function sets up the initial parameters and data for the algorithm, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Parameters**:\n",
    "     - `pvt_data`: Represents the input dataset, typically containing various PVT (pressure, volume, temperature) properties.\n",
    "     - `num_ants`: Defines the number of ants in each simulation cycle. A higher number increases exploration but also computational cost.\n",
    "     - `num_iterations`: Total number of cycles the algorithm will run to find an optimal path. Higher values allow more refinement but require more time.\n",
    "     - `decay`: A rate at which pheromone levels decay in each iteration. This prevents early paths from dominating and encourages fresh exploration.\n",
    "     - `alpha` and `beta`: These parameters influence how much pheromone strength (`alpha`) and distance (`beta`) impact an ant’s path choices:\n",
    "       - Higher `alpha` values increase reliance on pheromone trails.\n",
    "       - Higher `beta` values emphasize shorter distances, biasing the ants toward closer paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Distance Matrix**:  \n",
    "     The `distance_matrix` is calculated by calling `calculate_distance_matrix()`, which computes the Euclidean distance between every pair of points in the data. This matrix represents all possible \"paths\" the ants can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Pheromone Matrix**:  \n",
    "     The `pheromone_matrix` is initialized with equal values across all paths, representing initial pheromone levels that ants will use to choose paths. The matrix is divided by the total number of data points, ensuring small, uniform values at the start.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Shortest Path Tracking**:  \n",
    "     The algorithm stores the `shortest_path` and `shortest_cost` found so far to track the best route identified by the ants. Initially, `shortest_path` is empty, and `shortest_cost` is set to infinity so that any path found will be an improvement.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization of Matrix**:  \n",
    "   The function begins by determining the total number of points (`num_points`) in the `pvt_data` dataset. A zero-filled square matrix of shape `(num_points, num_points)` is created, where each element will later store the computed distance between two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop through Points**:  \n",
    "   A nested loop iterates through each pair of points `(i, j)`, where:\n",
    "   - For pairs where `i != j` (i.e., different points), the function calculates the Euclidean distance between points `i` and `j`.\n",
    "   - When `i == j` (the same point), the distance remains zero, as it’s a self-comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distance Calculation**:  \n",
    "   The Euclidean distance between points `i` and `j` is calculated using four features:\n",
    "   - `AVG_DOWNHOLE_PRESSURE`\n",
    "   - `AVG_DOWNHOLE_TEMPERATURE`\n",
    "   - `AVG_ANNULUS_PRESSURE`\n",
    "   - `AVG_CHOKE_SIZE_P`\n",
    "\n",
    "   For each feature, the difference between the values at points `i` and `j` is squared, and then all squared differences are summed. The square root of this sum is taken to obtain the Euclidean distance. This value represents the multidimensional distance between the conditions at these two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return Matrix**:  \n",
    "   After all pairs are processed, the distance matrix is returned. This matrix will be used by the ants to make path decisions, with closer points being more attractive paths in the optimization process.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Iteration Loop**:  \n",
    "   The loop iterates for `self.num_iterations`, which represents the total number of cycles the ants will perform in search of an optimal path. Each iteration allows the ants to explore new paths, gradually improving the pheromone trail toward an optimal solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Updating Pheromone Levels**:  \n",
    "   The `update_pheromone` function updates the pheromone matrix using the paths generated by the ants. Paths with shorter distances (or better performance) are rewarded with higher pheromone deposits, making them more attractive in future iterations. This process enhances the \"memory\" of the system, helping ants in future iterations follow paths that led to lower costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tracking the Shortest Path**:  \n",
    "   The `get_shortest_path` function is called to evaluate the cost of each ant’s path from the current iteration and identify the shortest one. If this path has a lower cost than any previously found, the algorithm updates `self.shortest_path` and `self.shortest_cost` to reflect this new optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Return Optimal Solution**:  \n",

    "   - `num_points` holds the total number of data points in the dataset (`self.pvt_data`).\n",

    "\n",
    "The `update_pheromone` function is responsible for modifying the pheromone levels on the paths based on the ants' movements and the distances traveled. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decay of Pheromone Levels**:  \n",
    "   - The pheromone levels in the matrix are reduced by a decay factor. This simulates the natural evaporation of pheromones over time, making older paths less attractive for future ants. \n",
    "\n",

    "   - For each path, it examines each segment of the path, specifically the transitions from one point to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Increase Pheromone Levels**:  \n",
    "   - The pheromone level on the edge between two consecutive points in the path is increased. This is done by the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A Comment Jpeg](../Image/imggg.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The amount added is inversely proportional to the distance between these two points. Shorter distances receive a greater pheromone boost, reinforcing paths that are considered more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overall Effect**:  \n",
    "   - By updating the pheromone levels in this way, the algorithm effectively encourages future ants to follow the more successful paths while discouraging them from taking longer, less optimal routes. Over multiple iterations, this helps to converge towards the most efficient solution based on the pheromone trails established by previous ants.\n"

    "   - Two variables are initialized: `shortest_cost` is set to infinity (`np.inf`), representing the lowest cost found so far, and `shortest_path` is initialized to `None`, which will hold the best path once found.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterate Through Ants' Paths**:  \n",
    "   - The function loops through each path generated by the ants (`for path in ants_paths:`). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Path Cost**:  \n",
    "   - For each path, the function calls `self.calculate_path_cost(path)` to compute the total cost associated with that path. This typically involves summing the distances or costs of traveling between each pair of points in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check for Shortest Path**:  \n",
    "   - The function compares the calculated `path_cost` with the current `shortest_cost`. If the `path_cost` is less than `shortest_cost`, it updates `shortest_cost` with the new lower cost and assigns `shortest_path` to the current `path`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Return the Results**:  \n",
    "   - After examining all paths, the function returns the best path and its corresponding cost as a tuple: `(shortest_path, shortest_cost)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Effect:\n",
    "- This function plays a crucial role in determining the most efficient route through the dataset, allowing the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm to focus on the most promising paths based on the costs calculated during the exploration phase.\n"

    "### Calculating Path Cost (`calculate_path_cost` function)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_path_cost` function is responsible for determining the total cost associated with a specific path taken by the ants. Here’s a breakdown of how this function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization of Path Cost**:  \n",
    "   - The function begins by initializing a variable called `path_cost`, which will accumulate the total cost of traveling along the specified path.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sum of Distances**:  \n",
    "   - The core calculation involves summing the distances between consecutive points in the path. This is achieved using a generator expression:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     sum(self.distance_matrix[path[i], path[i + 1]] for i in range(len(path) - 1))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Here, `path[i]` and `path[i + 1]` refer to two consecutive points in the path. The distance between these two points is retrieved from `self.distance_matrix`, which contains the precomputed distances between all pairs of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return the Total Cost**:  \n",
    "   - After calculating the sum of the distances, the function returns the total `path_cost`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Effect:\n",
    "- By calculating the path cost in this way, the function helps to quantify the efficiency of the route taken by the ants. Lower costs indicate more efficient paths, which the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm will seek to reinforce through pheromone updates.\n"
